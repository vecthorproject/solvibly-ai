export const ratioLearnMoreDict = {
  currentRatio: {
    significance: `Measures a company's ability to cover its short-term obligations (due within one year) with its short-term assets. It's a key indicator of liquidity.`,
    notes: `A value above 1.0 is generally considered healthy. However, the ideal ratio can vary significantly by industry. A very high ratio might suggest inefficient use of assets.`
  },
  quickRatio: {
    significance: `Similar to the Current Ratio, but excludes inventory from current assets. It provides a more conservative measure of liquidity.`,
    notes: `A value above 1.0 is strong, indicating the company can meet its short-term obligations without selling any inventory.`
  },
  debtToEquityRatio: {
    significance: `Indicates the proportion of a company's financing that comes from debt versus equity. It's a key measure of financial leverage.`,
    notes: `A high ratio indicates higher risk, as the company relies heavily on debt. A ratio below 1.0 is often considered safe, but this varies greatly by industry.`
  },
  debtToAssetsRatio: {
    significance: `Measures the percentage of a company's assets that are financed through debt.`,
    notes: `A ratio below 0.5 (50%) is generally considered less risky, as it means the majority of assets are financed by equity.`
  },
  interestCoverageRatio: {
    significance: `Measures how many times a company can cover its current interest payments with its available earnings (EBIT).`,
    notes: `A ratio above 1.5 is typically considered the minimum acceptable level. Higher is better, as it indicates a better ability to handle debt payments.`
  },
  roa: {
    significance: `Return on Assets (ROA) indicates how profitable a company is in relation to its total assets. It measures management's efficiency at using assets to generate earnings.`,
    notes: `A higher ROA is better. A value above 5% is often considered good.`
  },
  roe: {
    significance: `Return on Equity (ROE) measures the rate of return on the ownership interest (shareholders' equity) of the common stockholders.`,
    notes: `It's a key measure of profitability for investors. A value above 15% is often considered good.`
  },
  roi: {
    significance: `Return on Investment (ROI) measures the efficiency of the total capital invested (debt + equity) in generating operating profit (EBIT).`,
    notes: `It provides a broad view of the company's ability to generate profit from its capital base. A value above the company's cost of capital indicates value creation.`
  },
  ros: {
    significance: `Return on Sales (ROS) is a measure of how efficiently a company turns sales into profits (EBIT).`,
    notes: `It indicates the company's operational efficiency. A higher percentage is better.`
  },
  assetTurnover: {
    significance: `Measures the efficiency of a company's use of its assets in generating sales revenue.`,
    notes: `A higher ratio is generally better, but it is highly industry-dependent.`
  }
};

export const normativeLearnMoreDict = {
  dscr: {
    significance: `The Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) is a key forward-looking indicator required by the Italian Corporate Crisis Code. It measures the prospective ability of a company to cover its upcoming debt service (principal + interest) with its expected operating cash flow.`,
    notes: `A value below 1.0 is a primary alert signal, indicating that the company is not expected to generate enough cash to meet its financial obligations, suggesting a high risk of crisis. A value equal to 1.0 means the company can exactly cover its debt service, which is considered the minimum safe threshold.`
  },
};

export const modelLearnMoreDict = {
  altmanZScore: {
    significance: `The pioneering statistical model for predicting corporate bankruptcy, developed by Edward Altman in 1968. It combines five key financial ratios into a single score to classify a company's financial health into distinct zones.`,
    notes: `The model has three main variants: the original Z-Score for public manufacturing firms, the Z'-Score for private companies, and the Z''-Score for non-manufacturing firms. The zones (Distress, Grey, Safe) indicate the probability of financial distress within two years.`
  },
  springateSScore: {
    significance: `A four-ratio model developed in Canada that uses discriminant analysis to predict corporate failure. It was noted for its very high accuracy (92.5%) on its initial test sample.`,
    notes: `The model calculates a single score where a value below the cut-off of 0.862 indicates a high probability of bankruptcy. It's a straightforward and powerful alternative to the Altman model.`
  },
  tafflerTScore: {
    significance: `A UK-based solvency model, similar in structure to Altman's, used to predict corporate failure. It combines four key ratios related to profitability, working capital, financial risk, and liquidity.`,
    notes: `The score is interpreted through specific zones: a score below 0.2 indicates a high risk of failure, while a score above 0.3 suggests a low risk. The area in between is a "grey zone" requiring further analysis.`
  },
  fulmerHFactor: {
    significance: `A complex model developed from a large set of 40 financial ratios to predict bankruptcy one year in advance. It is noted for its statistical rigor and high accuracy in initial tests.`,
    notes: `The model's interpretation is straightforward: a negative H-Factor score (< 0) indicates a high probability of failure (Failure Zone), while a positive score suggests financial stability (Safe Zone).`
  },
  groverGScore: {
    significance: `A more recent and simpler model that uses only three financial ratios to predict bankruptcy. Despite its simplicity, it has shown very high predictive accuracy, often outperforming older models.`,
    notes: `The model provides a score where values below -0.02 are classified as financially distressed. It's a powerful example of a parsimonious model that achieves high performance with fewer variables.`
  },
  zmijewskiXScore: {
    significance: `Developed by Mark Zmijewski in 1984, this model uses a probit analysis to estimate the probability of financial distress. It is noted for its critique of the 'sample selection bias' of previous models.`,
    notes: `The model is praised for its simplicity, using only three common financial ratios (ROA, Debt Ratio, and Current Ratio). A higher score indicates a higher probability of default.` 
  },
  ohlsonOScore: {
    significance: `Developed by James Ohlson in 1980, this statistical model estimates the likelihood of corporate bankruptcy using a probit regression. It integrates leverage, liquidity, profitability, and income trend indicators into a single predictive score.`,
    notes: `The model combines nine key variables, including total assets (log size), debt ratio, working capital, cash flow, and recent earnings changes. Scores below -1.32 indicate low risk, between -1.32 and 0.5 represent a moderate zone, and above 0.5 signal high bankruptcy risk.`
